greta relies on some pretty incredible pieces of software.

Rstudio's [`reticulate`](https://github.com/rstudio/reticulate) and [`tensorflow`](https://rstudio.github.io/tensorflow/) packages bring Google TensorFlow and all things python to R.
Under the hood, greta also uses Winston Chang's [`R6`](https://github.com/wch/R6) object system.
greta's model plotting functionality is made possible by [`DiagrammeR`](http://rich-iannone.github.io/DiagrammeR/).

The design and scope of greta was inspired by other general-purpose MCMC software like [BUGS](http://www.openbugs.net/) and [JAGS](http://mcmc-jags.sourceforge.net/), but particularly by [Stan](http://mc-stan.org/).

The python package [Edward](http://edwardlib.org/) also uses TensorFlow as a backend for general-purpose statistical modelling, as does [GPflow](https://github.com/GPflow/GPflow), which was a source of inspiration for how greta is implemented.
